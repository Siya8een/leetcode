// In the corrected code, the line `vector<int> row(i + 1, 1);` initializes a vector named `row` with `i + 1` elements, all initialized to the value `1`.

// Let's break down the initialization:

// - `vector<int>` declares a vector of integers.
// - `row` is the name of the vector variable we are declaring.
// - `(i + 1, 1)` is the initializer part of the declaration.
// - `i + 1` specifies the size of the vector, which is equal to the row number (`i`) plus one. Since row numbers start from 0, we add 1 to get the correct size.
// - `, 1` initializes all the elements of the vector to the value `1`.

// For example, if `i` is 3, then `row` will be initialized as `{1, 1, 1, 1}` because the size is `i + 1` which is `3 + 1 = 4`, and all the elements are set to `1` as specified by the initializer.

// So, this initialization ensures that the `row` vector has the correct size for each row of Pascal's triangle, and all elements in the row are initially set to `1`.
