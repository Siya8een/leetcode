# leetcode
This repository contains a comprehensive collection of well-known data structures and algorithms implemented in various programming languages such as C and C++. The goal of this repository is to provide a valuable resource for learning and understanding data structures and algorithms by showcasing their implementations in different languages.

## Data Structures

The following data structures are covered in this repository:

- **Array**: A collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations.
- **Stack**: A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure.
- **Queue**: A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure.
- **Linked List**: A linear data structure where elements are linked using pointers.
- **Tree**: A hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges.
- **Graph**: A non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges.

Each data structure directory contains detailed explanations and implementations in different programming languages.


The repository also covers various commonly used in programming questions. These include:

- **2 Pointers**: A technique involving two pointers moving through an array or list.
- **Recursion**: A method of solving problems by breaking them down into smaller, similar subproblems.
- **Sliding Window**: A technique for efficiently processing arrays or lists by maintaining a "window" of elements.
- **Bit Manipulation**: Manipulating individual bits in binary representations of data.

Each algorithm section provides explanations and example implementations in different programming languages.

Feel free to explore the individual directories to learn more about each data structure and algorithm, along with their implementations in different programming languages.
